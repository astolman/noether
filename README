The /src/ directory contains all the source code, the contents of each 
subdirectory are:
- /src/concurrentboruvka - contains code for the boruvka's implementation
- /src/concurrentgraph - contains code for the graph ADT
- /src/fastconcurrentboruvka - contains the code for the coarse-grained
   locking implementation of Boruvka's algorithm which does not quite work
- /src/fastconcurrentgraph - contains code for the graph ADT with the 
   unsafe, non-locking versions of the operators
- /src/noether - contains the source code for the noether package
- /src/sequentialboruvka - code for the sequential boruvka used for 
   comparison
Any other directory probably contains old versions of programs that 
don't work.

make targets:
'make conboruvka' makes the noether implementation of boruvka's
'make seqboruvka' makes the sequential implementation of boruvka's
All the .class files are output in to the /build/ directory

To run concurrent boruvka:
The Makefile doesn't make any jar files. You can run them from the JVM
by typing 'java ConBoruvkaMain', it assumes the input is in a file in
the same directory titled 'graph.txt'
